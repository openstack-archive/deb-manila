        # (aovchinnikov): To actually make docker container mount a
        # logical volume created after container start-up to some location
        # inside it, we must share entire /dev with it. While seemingly
        # dangerous it is not and moreover this is apparently the only sane
        # way to do it. The reason is when a logical volume gets created
        # several new things appear in /dev: a new /dev/dm-X and a symlink
        # in /dev/volume_group_name pointing to /dev/dm-X. But to be able
        # to interact with /dev/dm-X, it must be already present inside
        # the container's /dev i.e. it must have been -v shared during
        # container start-up. So we should either precreate an unknown
        # number of /dev/dm-Xs (one per LV), share them all and hope
        # for the best or share the entire /dev and hope for the best.
        #
        # The risk of allowing a container having access to entire host's
        # /dev is not as big as it seems: as long as actual share providers
        # are invulnerable this does not pose any extra risks. If, however,
        # share providers contain vulnerabilities then the driver does not
        # provide any more possibilities for an exploitation than other
        # first-party drivers.
