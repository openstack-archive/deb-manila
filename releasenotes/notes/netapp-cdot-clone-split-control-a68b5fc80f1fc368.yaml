features:
  - NetApp cDOT driver now supports a scoped extra-spec
    ``netapp:split_clone_on_create`` to be used in share types when creating
    shares (NetApp FlexClone) from snapshots. If this extra-spec is not
    included, or set to ``false``, the cDOT driver will perform the clone-split
    only if/when the parent snapshot is being deleted.
