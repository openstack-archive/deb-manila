features:
  - HPE 3PAR driver now supports configuring multiple pools per backend.
upgrade:
  - HPE 3PAR driver no longer uses hpe3par_share_ip_address option in
    configuration. With pool support, configuration just requires
    hpe3par_fpg option or optionally supply share IP address(es) along with
    hpe3par_fpg.
