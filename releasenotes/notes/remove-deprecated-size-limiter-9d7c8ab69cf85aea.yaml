deprecations:
  - Removed manila RequestBodySizeLimiter shims and deprecation
    log messages since it has been deprecated since equivalent
    oslo.middleware library object was added in kilo.
upgrade:
  - Ensure that /etc/manila/api-paste.ini is up-to-date with
    etc/manila/api-paste.ini, in particular that [filter:sizelimit]
    section has
      paste.filter_factory = oslo_middleware.sizelimit:RequestBodySizeLimiter.factory
