prelude: >
    Manila scheduler checks "thin_provisioning" in extra specs of the share type
    and decides whether to use the logic for thin or thick. If "thin_provisioning"
    not given in extra specs, default use thin.
upgrade:
  - Remove the "AllocType" configuration from huawei driver configuration file.
    If "thin_provisioning" not given, default create new share by "thin" type.
