features:
  - Share can be managed with replication_type extra-spec
    in the share_type
issues:
  - Managing a share with replication_type can only be
    possible if the share does not already have replicas.
fixes:
  - Retrying to manage shares in ``manage_error`` status
    works as expected.
  - Snapshot manage and unmange operations are disabled
    for shares with replicas.
