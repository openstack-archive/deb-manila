security:
  - http_proxy_to_wsgi is taken into use instead of the deprecated ssl
    middleware. This makes it easier for deployers to have Manila running
    behind a proxy that terminates TLS connections. This middleware addition
    adds the enable_proxy_headers_parsing option to the oslo_middleware section
    which needs to be set in the configuration file in order to enable
    middleware to do its work.
