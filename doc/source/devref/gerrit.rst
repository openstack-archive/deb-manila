Code Reviews with Gerrit
========================

Manila uses the `Gerrit`_ tool to review proposed code changes. The review site
is http://review.openstack.org.

Gerrit is a complete replacement for Github pull requests. `All Github pull
requests to the manila repository will be ignored`.

See the `Development Workflow`_ for more detailed documentation on how
to work with Gerrit.
